introduction: The Catalog is the index of all imagery available within the system
---

OpenAerialMap Catalog is an application programming interface (API) that serves metadata about available images and map layers. The API provides access to all imagery metadata information. The API provides endpoints for lists of images available, map layer services available, as well as simple analytics.

See [status.openaerialmap.org](http://status.openaerialmap.org) for more information on system status.

## Quick Start

The Catalog API is split into three available endpoints: a metadata endpoint (/meta), an tiled map service (TMS) listing endpoint (/tms), and an analytics endpoint (/analytics). 

To get started, you can access the metadata endpoint here: http://api.openaerialmap.org/meta. 

## Further documentation 

Check out the full API documentation for methods to filter and limit results, get an individual image metadata, or add TMS endpoints to the listing: [hotosm.github.io/oam-catalog/](http://hotosm.github.io/oam-catalog/).
