introduction: The Uploader is the tool and API to publish and share collected aerial imagery into the OAM system.
---

The OAM imagery database is made of the contributions of users, but to ensure the quality and accuracy of the contents the uploaders need to be approved.  
Users have to [request a token](https://upload.openaerialmap.org/) which then can be used in the upload form to validate their identity. Learn more about [how to upload](/uploader/uploader-form/).

The OAM uploader consists of three different tools:

- the upload form
- the token manager app
- and the server to glue everything together
