introduction: Admin interface to manage tokens to allow imagery upload
---
The token is a hexadecimal access code that allows the upload of imagery to the OAM database.
Administrators can create and manage tokens using the [admin interface](https://admin.openaerialmap.org).

Since tokens are not tied to a specific user, a description allows the admin to keep track of the purpose of each one.

Tokens can have an expiracy date, a feature that is useful if the token is being generated, for example, for a mapping event. They can also be temporarily blocked and/or revoked when needed.
