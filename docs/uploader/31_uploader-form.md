### Token
Users need a valid token to submit imagery. This helps the OAM team ensure the quality of the submitted materials.  
The token can be requested either by email or through a github issue. When done via the "Request token" button on the [upload form](https://upload.openaerialmap.org) the email/issue will have a template prompting the user for all the needed information.

### Contributing
