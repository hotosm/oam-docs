introduction: An introduction to the OAM Browser
---

Imagery from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other aircraft are becoming available at ever increasing rates. It is often difficult to determine what is available and easily access it.

The OAM Browser aims to provide a simple way to find and access aerial imagery.  
It features an interactive grid that simplifies the process of finding imagery for a particular location, and a set of filters that allow you to refine the search even further.

The images can be freely downloaded and used, and some also have a map layer available which can be used with different programs.

### Source code and development
