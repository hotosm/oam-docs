introduction: The uploader allows willing users to contribute to the OAM database
---

The OAM imagery database is made of the contributions of users, but to ensure the quality and accuracy of the contents the uploaders need to be approved.  
Users have to [request a token](https://upload.openaerialmap.org/) which then can be used in the upload form to validate their identity.  

The OAM uploader consists of three different tools:

- the upload form
- the token manager app
- and the server to glue everything together.
