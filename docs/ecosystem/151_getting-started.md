introduction: An overview of the OpenAerialMap components and how they connect with each other.
---

Imagery from satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and other aircraft is becoming increasingly available after a disaster. It is often difficult to determine what is available and easily access it. OpenAerialMap (OAM) seeks to solve this by providing a simple open way to host and provide access to imagery for humanitarian response and disaster preparedness.

OpenAerialMap relies on a set of open source tools to accomplish its goals. These components can be divided into two main functionalities:

- The "Catalog" group: components related to processing imagery metadata and creating the OpenAerialMap Catalog
- The "Contributor" group: components related to uploading new data to OpenAerialMap as a contributor

Since OpenAerialMap is composed of open source blocks, you can host your own version of OAM. Visit the "Roll your own" tab to learn how to install the components and help in development.
